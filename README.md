## What is Zation-service-nodemailer?
***Zation-service-nodemailer*** is a zation service wrapper of the npm package [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) for sending emails from a zation server.
This service will automatically create transporters with your provided instance configurations.
Also, it will extend the Bag with new functionality to easily send emails or access the transporter instances.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --save zation-service-nodemailer
```

## Usage
To use this service, you have to define it in the services configuration of your zation server. 
To do this, use the default exported function that requires an instances argument.
In this argument, you can define different transporter configurations linked to a name (instanceName). 
The transport options are the same as in the npm module [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer).  
If you only want to specify one transporter or 
you have a primary transporter that you will use the most it is recommended to use the default instance name for it.
That will make it later easier to access the transporter because you don't have to provide every time the instance name.

```typescript
import {Config}          from "zation-server";
import NodeMailerService from "zation-service-nodemailer";

export default Config.servicesConfig({
    ...NodeMailerService({
        default: {
            service: 'gmail',
            auth: {
                pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD,
                user: process.env.EMAIL_USER
            },
            tsl: {
                rejectUnauthorized: false
            }
        }
    })
});
```
In this example code, the zation server will create the defined transporter in the start process.
After the launch, the transporter can be accessed by using the Bag.

### Access 
To access your transporters, you can use one of these new functionalities that will be added to the Bag class.
Notice that this service also adds the typescript definitions.
The new functionalities:

* `getNodeMailer` (`Function (instanceName?: string) => Promise<Transporter>`) - This function returns the transporter instance, if it exists otherwise, it will throw a ServiceNotFoundError error. 
It takes a instance name as an argument if you don't provide one it will use the default instance name.
                                
* `hasNodeMailer` (`Function (instanceName?: string) => boolean`) - This function returns a boolean that indicates if the transporter instance exists. 
If you don't provide a instance name, it will use the default instance name.

* `sendMail` (`Function (mailOptions: Options, instanceName?: string) => Promise<SentMessageInfo>`) - With this function, you can simply send an email promise based by using one of your transporter instances.
Notice that this function can throw a ServiceNotFoundError error if the transporter with the instance name is not found.
The function takes the mailOptions and the instance name as arguments.
If you don't provide a instance name, it will use the default instance name.
```typescript
const mailOptions = {
    from: '"Fred Foo üëª" <foo@example.com>', // sender address
    to: 'bar@example.com, baz@example.com', // list of receivers
    subject: 'Hello ‚úî', // Subject line
    text: 'Hello world?', // plain text body
    html: '<b>Hello world?</b>' // html body
};
const info = await bag.sendMail(mailOptions);
```
