## What is Zation-service-nodemailer?
***Zation-service-nodemailer*** is a zation service module wrapper of the npm package [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) for sending emails from a zation server.
This module will automatically create transporter with your provided transport configurations on each worker. 
Also, it will add new functionality to the SmallBag and Bag for easy sending emails or access the transporter instance.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --save zation-service-nodemailer
```

## Usage

To use this module, you have to define it in the service configuration of your zation server. 
Therefore you must use the build method, and this method requires a configuration argument. 
In the configuration argument, you can define different transport configurations linked to a name (configName). 
The transport options are the same as in the npm module [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer).  
If you only want to specify one transport or 
you have a primary transport that you will use the most it is recommended to use the default config name for it.
That will make it later easier to access the transporter because you don't have to provide every time the config name.

```typescript
import {Config}         from 'zation-server';
import NodeMailerModule from "zation-service-nodemailer";

module.exports = Config.serviceConfig(
    { 
        serviceModules : [
        NodeMailerModule.build({
            default: {
                service: 'gmail',
                auth: {
                    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD,
                    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER
                },
                tsl: {
                    rejectUnauthorized: false
                }
            }
        })]
    });
```
In this example code, each worker of the zation server will create defined transporter in the start with the transport configuration.
After the launch, the transporter can be accessed by using a SmallBag or Bag. 
If something goes wrong by creating the transporter, the server won't start or notify you with a console.log it depends on your configurations of the server.

### Access 
For access to your transporter, you can use one of these new functionalities that will be added to the SmallBag class. 
Notice that this module also adds the typescript definitions and 
that you can use these methods even on the Bag class because the Bag is extending the SmallBag.
The new functionalities:

* `getNodeMailer` (`Function (configName ?: string) => Promise<Transporter>`) - This function returns the transporter, if it exists otherwise, it will throw a ServiceNotFoundError error. 
It takes a config name as an argument if you don't provide one it will use the default config name. 
                                
* `isNodeMailer` (`Function (configName ?: string) => boolean`) - This function returns a boolean that indicates if the transporter with the given configuration name exists. 
If you don't provide a config name, it will use the default name.

* `sendMail` (`Function (mailOptions: Options, configName ?: string) => Promise<SentMessageInfo>`) - With this function, you can simply send an email promise based by using one of your transporters.
Notice that this function can throw a ServiceNotFoundError if the transporter with the config name is not found.
The function takes the mailOptions and the config name as arguments.
If you don't provide a config name, it will use the default name.
```typescript
const mailOptions = {
    from: '"Fred Foo üëª" <foo@example.com>', // sender address
    to: 'bar@example.com, baz@example.com', // list of receivers
    subject: 'Hello ‚úî', // Subject line
    text: 'Hello world?', // plain text body
    html: '<b>Hello world?</b>' // html body
};
const info = await bag.sendMail(mailOptions);
```
